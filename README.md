# K-Means Clustering
 The purpose of this notebook is to analyze the sales of an online retail store for a year, in order to be able to define what groups of clients they have and thus be able to launch personalized marketing campaigns. We will pay attention to three variables: the amount of purchases, the number of products purchased and the time elapsed since the last purchase.  For this we will use a clustering model based on KMeans.
